# Current-Weather-App

## 1 App Architecture
#### 1.1 General App Architecture
The application uses [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) to inject `repositories` (whom maintain data layer and business logic) into different components of the app (fragments, activities, views, services, test cases, presenters, etc...).

**Important Note:** All presenters and classes interacts with the `repositories` **interfaces** only and does not interact with data sources directly.
#### 1.2 Data Layer:
Repository pattren has been implemented as data source of truth for the presenters it can be found under [`data.repositories`](https://github.com/zack-barakat/Current-Weather-App/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/android/weathertestapp/data/repositories) package. Each repository will have remote data source and local data source to support offline mode.
Dagger2 should maintain **only one copy** of each repository per app session (Singlton behaviour).

* **WeatherRepository**: Responsible for all weather data such as (fetching current weather, presisting weather,and etc...).

#### 1.3 UI componentes architecture
Model View Preseneter known as MVP is the the architecture pattern used to develop the Weather app test application UI.
**Model:** It is responsible for handling the data part of the application.
**View:** It is responsible for laying out the views with specific data on the screen.
**Presenter:** It is a bridge that connects a Model and a View. It also acts as an instructor to the View.

## 4 Unit Test

#### All presenters have equivalent test presenets to test mvp intercations and ensure logic is done properly

## 5 App UI flow and functionality
#### There are only one screen in the app, Current Weather screen where user can view current weather info for a particular city and allow users to select from predefined city and get its weather.
### Current Weather Screen
